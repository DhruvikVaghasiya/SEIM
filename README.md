# 🚀 Cybersecurity Internship at Srida IT Consulting & Services (OPC) Pvt Ltd

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on journey through **Phase 1** of the Cybersecurity Internship at **Srida IT Consulting & Services (OPC) Pvt Ltd**, under the guidance of **Rajendra Bodda**. The focus of this phase was on foundational and practical skills essential for Blue Team operations, including threat detection, log analysis, and security monitoring using industry-standard tools.

Rather than just listing steps, I aimed to explain **each concept in detail**, with simplified explanations so that even beginners can understand how each scenario is built, executed, and analyzed. This approach is meant to not only serve as a portfolio of my work but also as a learning resource for others.
